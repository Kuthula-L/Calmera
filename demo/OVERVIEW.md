Calmera
```

## ðŸš€ Summary
```
The app provides a safe, anonymous space for people to connect, chat, and track their mental health. It includes an AI chatbot for instant support and integrates trusted South African helplines for professional help when needed. This combination makes mental health care more accessible, private, and supportive.
```

## âœ¨ Key Features
``` c
 
Mental Health Tracking â€“ Track your emotional well-being with a streak-based system and receive personalized progress feedback. 
Safe Space Chat â€“ Engage in anonymous conversations with people who may relate to your experiences in a supportive environment with an ai chat moderator to prevent harmful messages from being sent.

``` 

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
A strong inspiration behind this idea is the growing need for accessible, stigma-free mental health support. Many people hesitate to seek help openly because of judgment, cost, or not knowing where to start. By combining anonymity, AI, and helpline access, the app is inspired by the vision of giving everyone a safe first step toward care â€” anytime, anywhere.
